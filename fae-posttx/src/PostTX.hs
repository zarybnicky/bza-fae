Module: PostTX
Description: Command-line utility for creating and sending Fae transactions
Copyright: (c) Ryan Reich, 2017-2018
License: MIT
Maintainer: ryan.reich@gmail.com
Stability: experimental

This utility pairs with 'faeServer' by constructing an HTTP query of the
form that it expects in order to send a transaction specified in
human-readable form in a file on disk.  It has several additional modes
where it can operate on a transaction that has already been sent, or send
the transaction through an Ethereum client using 'faeServer''s Faeth
protocol.
