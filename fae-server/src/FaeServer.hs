Module: FaeServer
Description: Simple HTTP-based server for Fae transactions
Copyright: (c) Ryan Reich, 2017-2018
License: MIT
Maintainer: ryan.reich@gmail.com
Stability: experimental

This program, which rises to slightly above the level of a utility, is
a complete Fae node, excepting the part of that job that involves the
blockchain.  It exposes its functionality via a regular HTTP
query-parameter interface (it would be misleading to call it a REST
protocol) and returns the results, mostly, as JSON, both of which are
hopefully standard enough to be interoperable with other things.
